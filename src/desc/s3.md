# S3 Server

### Description

**S3 Server** (S3 Server) is an object (file) storage platform ([S3 storage](/intro/architecture.md#components)) for storing data (scripts, package files, etc.).

The [MinIO](https://min.io/) software product is used as the base product, which allows you to organize various data storage architectures (including distributed ones), and is also compatible with the [S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html) data access standard.

The platform allows you to connect external storages that use the specified API type for access. For example, you can use an external cloud storage based on [Yandex Object Storage](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/services/storage), [VK Cloud Storage](https://mcs.mail.ru/storage/) or [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Thus, you can connect an unlimited number of object storages, both local and external, and use them to store data for various projects. If different projects use the same instance of object storage, then for the purpose of isolation they are placed in different buckets, which provide both logical and physical separation of data.

    When data is deleted, it remains in storage. To actually free up space, you need to run a storage cleanup. The cleanup can be initiated by the server owner, otherwise the cleanup will be run automatically by the platform once a day. This also recalculates the amount of space used by projects on the S3 server.
